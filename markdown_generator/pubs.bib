abstract = {Understanding tropical rainforest carbon exchange and its response to heat and drought is critical for quantifying the effects of climate change on tropical ecosystems, including global climate-carbon feedbacks. Of particular importance for the global carbon budget is net biome exchange of {CO2} with the atmosphere ({NBE}), which represents nonfire carbon fluxes into and out of biomass and soils. Subannual and sub-Basin Amazon {NBE} estimates have relied heavily on process-based biosphere models, despite lack of model agreement with plot-scale observations. We present a new analysis of airborne measurements that reveals monthly, regional-scale (\~1-8 × 10(6)  km(2) ) {NBE} variations. We develop a regional atmospheric {CO2} inversion that provides the first analysis of geographic and temporal variability in Amazon biosphere-atmosphere carbon exchange and that is minimally influenced by biosphere model-based first guesses of seasonal and annual mean fluxes. We find little evidence for a clear seasonal cycle in Amazon {NBE} but do find {NBE} sensitivity to aberrations from long-term mean climate. In particular, we observe increased {NBE} (more carbon emitted to the atmosphere) associated with heat and drought in 2010, and correlations between wet season {NBE} and precipitation (negative correlation) and temperature (positive correlation). In the eastern Amazon, pulses of increased {NBE} persisted through 2011, suggesting legacy effects of 2010 heat and drought. We also identify regional differences in postdrought {NBE} that appear related to long-term water availability. We examine satellite proxies and find evidence for higher gross primary productivity ({GPP}) during a pulse of increased carbon uptake in 2011, and lower {GPP} during a period of increased {NBE} in the 2010 dry season drought, but links between {GPP} and {NBE} changes are not conclusive. These results provide novel evidence of {NBE} sensitivity to short-term temperature and moisture extremes in the Amazon, where monthly and sub-Basin estimates have not been previously available. \copyright 2016 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.}

abstract = {The anthropogenic and the natural biosphere components of the carbon cycle play critically important roles in determining the future status of earth's climate. While our knowledge of {CO2} fluxes, at large (global) and small (\~1 km2) scales are fairly well known, much uncertainty exists at intermediate/regional-scales (i.e., sub-continental, biome-level). Knowledge at these regional scales is vital for informing relevant climate change mitigation strategies (e.g., land management, fossil fuel emissions reduction policies) and for improving the characterization of key carbon-climate feedback mechanisms. This dissertation leverages the information content of a recent 4-fold increase in atmospheric {CO2} observation locations over North America to investigate carbon fluxes, both anthropogenic and natural, at the regional scale (e.g., biome/sub-continental). This work specifically emphasizes the exploration and characterization of spatial and temporal patterns of surface fluxes rather than focusing solely on carbon budgets. With the growing interest in independently verifying fossil fuel {CO2} ({FFCO2}) emissions using atmospheric {CO2} emissions, there exists a crucial need to understand the capabilities of the atmospheric observation network to isolate the {FF} signal. The first study explores and identifies when and where the space-time patterns of monthly sub-continental {FFCO2} emissions are detectable using the atmospheric {CO2} observation network. Winter months and regions with a relatively high density of observations (e.g., Midwest) offer the best opportunity to detect {FFCO2} emissions patterns. The combined impact of the natural biospheric signal and atmospheric transport model related issues are identified as severely hampering the detection of the {FFCO2} signal in spring, summer, and autumn. This first study provides key guidance for future efforts to independently estimate {FFCO2} emissions using atmospheric {CO2} observations through a systematic examination of the various factors hampering detectability. The second study quantifies the ability of a promising new remote sensing data set, solar-induced fluorescence ({SIF}), to inform spatiotemporal patterns at previously unexplored regional scales. The potential of {SIF} lies in its ability to measure an emission that, unlike previous reflectance based vegetation indices, is directly related to photosynthesis rather than a measure of the "greenness" of the land surface. While {SIF} has been explored at local and global scales, here, {SIF} is shown to explain {CO2} flux patterns within continental and biome regions better than existing vegetation and climate indicators as well as most process-based terrestrial biosphere models ({TBMs}). By incorporating {SIF} into an inverse model, {SIF} is found to inform a significant increase in the net uptake of {CO2} over croplands as well as a significant decrease over needleleaf forests. The final study explores the regional drivers of interannual variability ({IAV}) for the net North American {CO2} land sink using inverse estimates of net {CO2} flux derived from six years of observations. Understanding the current drivers of {IAV} is crucial for improving predictions of the future response of the terrestrial biosphere to climate change. This work identifies the deciduous broadleaf and mixed forest biomes as the primary regional drivers of {IAV} over North America, which differs from the dominant drivers identified for the globe and for the northern hemisphere. When comparing the inverse-modelling-derived estimates to a suite of ten {TBMs}, the large spread in {TBM} based biome-level contributions to North American {IAV} make identifying a dominant biome-level driver not possible. The wide spread among {TBM} based biome-level {IAV} contributions is attributed to a trade-off between the contribution of {IAV} in forested vs non-forested regions in a given {TBM}. This trade-off corresponds with emergent regional sensitivities to environmental drivers (temperature, precipitation, and radiation) where {TBMs} with {IAV} dominated by forested regions exhibit stronger sensitivity to environmental drivers in forested regions relative to non-forested regions and vice-versa. This trade-off helps to explain the inability of {TBMs} to agree on a dominant regional driver of {IAV} and calls into question the ability of {TBMs} to inform regional-scale carbon flux {IAV} dynamics.},

abstract = {Terrestrial biospheric models ({TBMs}) are used to extrapolate local observations and process-level understand- ing of land-atmosphere carbon exchange to larger regions, and serve as predictive tools for examining carbon-climate interactions. Understanding the performance of {TBMs} is thus crucial to the carbon cycle and climate science communities. In this study, we present and assess an approach to eval- uating the spatiotemporal patterns, rather than aggregated magnitudes, of net ecosystem exchange ({NEE}) simulated by {TBMs} using atmospheric {CO2} measurements. The approach is based on statistical model selection implemented within a high-resolution atmospheric inverse model. Using synthetic data experiments, we find that current atmospheric obser- vations are sensitive to the underlying spatiotemporal flux variability at sub-biome scales for a large portion of North America, and that atmospheric observations can therefore be used to evaluate simulated spatiotemporal flux patterns as well as to differentiate between multiple competing {TBMs}. Experiments using real atmospheric observations and four prototypical {TBMs} further confirm the applicability of the method, and demonstrate that the performance of {TBMs} in simulating the spatiotemporal patterns of {NEE} varies sub- stantially across seasons, with best performance during the growing season and more limited skill during transition sea- sons. This result is consistent with previous work showing that the ability of {TBMs} to model flux magnitudes is also seasonally-dependent. Overall, the proposed approach pro- vides a new avenue for evaluating {TBM} performance based on sub-biome-scale flux patterns, presenting an opportunity for assessing and informing model development using atmo- spheric observations.}

abstract = {[1] Estimates of surface fluxes of carbon dioxide ({CO2}) can be derived from atmospheric {CO2} concentration measurements through the solution of an inverse problem, but the sparseness of the existing {CO2} monitoring network is often cited as a main limiting factor in constraining fluxes. Existing methods for assessing or designing monitoring networks either primarily rely on expert knowledge, or are sensitive to the large number of modeling choices and assumptions inherent to the solution of inverse problems. This study proposes a monitoring network evaluation and design approach based on the quantification of the spatial variability in modeled atmospheric {CO2}. The approach is used to evaluate the 2004–2008 North American network expansion and to create two hypothetical further expansions. The less stringent expansion guarantees a monitoring tower within one correlation length ({CL}) of each location (1 {CL}), requiring an additional eight towers relative to 2008. The more stringent network includes a tower within one half of a {CL} (½ {CL}) and requires 35 towers beyond the 1 {CL} network. The two proposed networks are evaluated against the network in 2008, which temporarily had the most continuous monitoring sites in North America thanks to the Mid-Continent Intensive project. Evaluation using a synthetic data inversion shows a marked improvement in the ability to constrain both continental- and biome-scale fluxes, especially in areas that are currently under-sampled. The proposed approach is flexible, computationally inexpensive, and provides a quantitative design tool that can be used in concert with existing tools to inform atmospheric monitoring needs.}

Here we explore a necessary but not sufficient component of this goal, namely, the basic question of the detectability of {FFCO2} emissions from subcontinental regions. Detectability is evaluated by examining the degree to which {FFCO2} emissions patterns from specific regions are needed to explain the variability observed in high-frequency atmospheric {CO2} observations. Analyses using a {CO2} monitoring network of 35 continuous measurement towers over North America show that {FFCO2} emissions are difficult to detect during nonwinter months. We find that the compounding effects of the seasonality of atmospheric transport patterns and the biospheric {CO2} flux signal dramatically hamper the detectability of {FFCO2} emissions. Results from several synthetic data case studies highlight the need for advancements in data coverage and transport model accuracy if the goal of atmospheric measurement-based {FFCO2} emissions detection and estimation is to be achieved beyond urban scales. {KEY} {POINTS}: Poor detectability of fossil fuel {CO2} emissions from subcontinental {regionsDetectability} assessed via attribution of emissions patterns in atmospheric {dataLoss} in detectability due to transport modeling errors and biospheric signal.}

We estimate these responses corresponded to 0.61 (0.45 to 0.79) {PgC} year-1 more North American carbon uptake during El Niño than during La Niña between 2007 and 2015, partially offsetting increases of net tropical biosphere-to-atmosphere carbon flux around El Niño. Anomalies in derived North American net ecosystem exchange ({NEE}) display strong but opposite correlations with surface air temperature between seasons, while their correlation with water availability was more constant throughout the year, such that water availability is the dominant control on annual {NEE} variability over North America. These results suggest that increased water availability and favorable temperature conditions (warmer spring and cooler summer) caused enhanced carbon uptake over North America near and during El Niño.}

abstract = {Where does the carbon released by burning fossil fuels go? Currently, ocean and land systems remove about half of the {CO} 2 emitted by human activities; the remainder stays in the atmosphere. These removal processes are sensitive to feedbacks in the energy, carbon, and water cycles that will change in the future. Observing how much carbon is taken up on land through photosynthesis is complicated because carbon is simultaneously respired by plants, animals, and microbes. Global observations from satellites and air samples suggest that natural ecosystems take up about as much {CO} 2 as they emit. To match the data, our land models generate imaginary Earths where carbon uptake and respiration are roughly balanced, but the absolute quantities of carbon being exchanged vary widely. Getting the magnitude of the flux is essential to make sure our models are capturing the right pattern for the right reasons. Combining two cutting edge tools, carbonyl sulfide ({OCS}) and solar-induced fluorescence ({SIF}), will help develop an independent answer of how much carbon is being taken up by global ecosystems. Photosynthesis requires {CO} 2 , light, and water. {OCS} provides a spatially and temporally-integrated picture of the \textquoteleftfront door\textquoteright of photosynthesis, proportional to {CO} 2 uptake and water loss through plant stomata. {SIF} provides a high-resolution snapshot of the \textquoteleftside door\textquoteright, scaling with the light captured by leaves. These two independent pieces of information help us understand plant water and carbon exchange. A coordinated effort to generate {SIF} and {OCS} data through satellite, airborne, and ground observations will improve our process-based models to predict how these cycles will change in the future.}
