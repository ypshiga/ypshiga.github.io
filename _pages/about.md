Hi! My name is Yoichi Shiga, I am a Visiting Associate Scientist, Earth Science at Universities Space Research Association as part of the NASA Academic Mission Services ([NAMS](https://nams.usra.edu/)) contract at NASAâ€™s Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California. I work primarily with the [Earth Science Division](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/earthscience) at NASA Ames.

My research
======
My research focuses on exploring the terretrial carbon cycle using a combination of atmospheric observations, remote sensing, inverse modeling, and geostatistical data fusion approaches. Using these tools, I primarily  seek to improve our understanding of the integrated dynamics of land-atmosphere exchanges at region-to-continental scales. 

My background
======
I recieved my BS in aerospace engineering at UCSD. I then recieved by MS in Environmental Engineering from University of Michigan and my PhD from Stanford University (also in Environmental Engineering).

My teaching
======
I have always had a passion for teaching. I have taught various age groups from elementary aged students to continuing studies students. I approach teaching as a way to engage learners in an experience that stimulates critical thinking.
