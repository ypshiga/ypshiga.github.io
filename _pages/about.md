Hi! My name is Yoichi Shiga, I am an Earth Scientist at [Universities Space Research Association](https://www.usra.edu/){:target="_blank"}. I work primarily with the [Earth Science Division](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/earthscience){:target="_blank"} at NASA Ames as a part of the NASA Academic Mission Services ([NAMS](https://nams.usra.edu/){:target="_blank"}) contract.

My research
======
My research focuses on exploring the terrestrial carbon cycle using a combination of atmospheric observations, remote sensing, inverse modeling, and geostatistical data fusion techniques. Using these tools, I primarily seek to improve our understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of land-atmosphere carbon exchanges at region-to-continental scales. 

I am currently working on a project to estimate North American photosynthetic carbon fluxes by combining atmospheric carbonyl sulfide measurements and remotely sensed solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence in a geostatistical inverse model.

My background
======
I received my BS in Aerospace Engineering from the University of California San Diego and my MS in Environmental Engineering from University of Michigan. I recieved my PhD from Stanford University with Anna Michalak from the Carnegie Institution for Science's [Department of Global Ecology](https://dge.carnegiescience.edu/){:target="_blank"}.

My teaching
======
I have a passion for teaching and have taught various age groups from elementary aged children to undergraduates to grandparents. Most recently I am teaching _Air Pollution_ METR 113 in the Meteorology and Climate Science Department at [SJSU] (https://www.sjsu.edu/meteorology/){:target="_blank_"}. I have also taught _Sustainability Challenges and Transitions_ for first year undergraduates and _Solving Climate Change_ a continuing studies course. I approach teaching as a way to engage learners in an experience that stimulates critical thinking.
