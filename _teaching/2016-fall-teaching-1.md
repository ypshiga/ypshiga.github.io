I taught THINK40 a Thinkings Matters course in the Fall of 2016 for first year Stanford University undergraduates. The course focused on practicing and developing critical thinking and writing skills on the topics of Energy, Food, and Water. For this course I collaborated with teaching team to design syllabi, assignments, assessments and lesson plans. I led a 16 student sections twice a week and individual tutorials twice a quarter.
